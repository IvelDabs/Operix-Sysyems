# GitHub Copilot / Agent Instructions (Project-specific)

This project is a small marketing site. The agent should:

- Open `index.html` in the `logix-control` folder to view the page structure.
- Styles are in `styles.css` and behavior in `script.js`.
- Preview locally via `python -m http.server 8000` from the `logix-control` folder.
- Replace placeholder contacts (`hello@example.com` and WhatsApp number) in `index.html`.

If expanding the site, keep assets in the same folder and update `README.md` with exact commands.
